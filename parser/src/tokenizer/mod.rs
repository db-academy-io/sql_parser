/// When processing SQL statements, SQLite (as does every other SQL database
/// engine) breaks the SQL statement up into [`token`](crate::Token) which are then forwarded
/// to the parser component. SQL statements are split into tokens by the
/// [`Tokenizer`] component of SQLite.
///
/// This document specifies requirements that precisely define the operation
/// of the SQLite tokenizer.
///
/// ### Character classes
///
///
/// SQL statements are composed of unicode characters. Specific individual
/// characters many be described using a notation consisting of the character
/// "u" followed by four hexadecimal digits.
///
/// For example, the lower-case letter `"a"` can be expressed as `"u0061"`
/// and the dollar sign can be expressed as "u0024". For notational convenience,
/// the following character classes are defined:
///
/// - WHITESPACE
///   One of these five characters: u0009, u000a, u000c, u000d, or u0020
///
/// - ALPHABETIC
///   Any of the characters in the range u0041 through u005a (letters "A"
///   through "Z") or in the range u0061 through u007a (letters "a" through "z")
///   or the character u005f ("_") or any other character larger than u007f.
///
/// - NUMERIC
///   Any of the characters in the range u0030 through u0039 (digits "0"
///   through "9")
///
/// - ALPHANUMERIC
///   Any character which is either ALPHABETIC or NUMERIC
///
/// - HEXADECIMAL
///   Any NUMERIC character or a characters in the range u0041 through u0046
///   ("A" through "F") or in the range u0061 through u0066 ("a" through "f")
///
/// - SPECIAL
///   Any character that is not WHITESPACE, ALPHABETIC, nor NUMERIC
///
/// ### Token requirements
///
/// - Processing is left-to-right. This seems obvious, but it needs to be
///   explicitly stated.
///
/// - H41010: SQLite shall divide input SQL text into tokens working from
///   left to right. The standard practice in SQL, as with most context-free
///   grammar based programming languages, is to resolve ambiguities in
///   tokenizing by selecting the option that results in the longest tokens.
///
/// - H41020: At each step in the SQL tokenization process, SQLite shall
///   extract the longest possible token from the remaining input text.
///   
/// - The tokenizer recognizes tokens one by one and passes them on to the
///   parser. Except whitespace is ignored. The only use for whitespace is as a
///   separator between tokens.
///
/// - H41030: The tokenizer shall pass each non-WHITESPACE token seen on to
///   the parser in the order in which the tokens are seen. The tokenizer
///   appends a semicolon to the end of input if necessary. This ensures that
///   every SQL statement is terminated by a semicolon.
///
/// - H41040: When the tokenizer reaches the end of input where the last token
///   sent to the parser was not a SEMI token, it shall send a SEMI token to
///   the parser. An unrecognized token generates an immediate error and aborts
///   the parse.
///
/// - H41050: When the tokenizer encounters text that is not a valid token, it
///   shall cause an error to be returned to the application.
///
///
/// #### Whitespace tokens
///
/// Whitespace has the usual definition.
///
/// - H41100: SQLite shall recognize a sequence of one or more WHITESPACE
///   characters as a WHITESPACE token. An SQL comment is "--" through the end
///   of line and is understood as whitespace.
///
/// - H41110: SQLite shall recognize as a WHITESPACE token the two-character
///   sequence "--" (u002d, u002d) followed by any sequence of non-zero
///   characters up through and including the first u000a character or until
///   end of input. A C-style comment "/*...*/" is also recognized as
///   white-space.
///
/// - H41120: SQLite shall recognize as a WHITESPACE token the two-character
///   sequence "/*" (u002f, u002a) followed by any sequence of zero or more
///   non-zero characters through with the first "*/" (u002a, u002f) sequence
///   or until end of input.
///
///
/// #### Identifier tokens
///
/// Identifiers follow the usual rules with the exception that SQLite allows
/// the dollar-sign symbol in the interior of an identifier. The dollar-sign
/// is for compatibility with Microsoft SQL-Server and is not part of the SQL
/// standard.
///
/// - H41130: SQLite shall recognize as an ID token any sequence of characters
///   that begins with an ALPHABETIC character and continue with zero or more
///   ALPHANUMERIC characters and/or "$" (u0024) characters and which is not a
///   keyword token. Identifiers can be arbitrary character strings within
///   square brackets. This feature is also for compatibility with Microsoft
///   SQL-Server and not a part of the SQL standard.
///
/// - H41140: SQLite shall recognize as an ID token any sequence of non-zero
///   characters that begins with "[" (u005b) and continuing through the
///   first "]" (u005d) character. The standard way of quoting SQL identifiers
///   is to use double-quotes.
///
/// - H41150: SQLite shall recognize as an ID token any sequence of characters
///   that begins with a double-quote (u0022), is followed by zero or more
///   non-zero characters and/or pairs of double-quotes (u0022) and terminates
///   with a double-quote (u0022) that is not part of a pair. MySQL allows
///   identifiers to be quoted using the grave accent character. SQLite
///   supports this for interoperability.
///
/// - H41160: SQLite shall recognize as an ID token any sequence of characters
///   that begins with a grave accent (u0060), is followed by zero or more
///   non-zero characters and/or pairs ofgrave accents (u0060) and terminates
///   with a grave accent (u0022) that is not part of a pair.
///
///
/// ### Literals
///
/// This is the usual definition of string literals for SQL. SQL uses the
/// classic Pascal string literal format.
///
/// - H41200: SQLite shall recognize as a STRING token a sequence of
///   characters that begins with a single-quote (u0027), is followed by zero
///   or more non-zero characters and/or pairs of single-quotes (u0027) and
///   terminates with a single-quote (u0027) that is not part of a pair.
///   Blob literals are similar to string literals except that they begin with
///   a single "X" character and contain hexadecimal data.
///
/// - H41210: SQLite shall recognize as a BLOB token an upper or lower-case
///   "X" (u0058 or u0078) followed by a single-quote (u0027) followed by a
///   number of HEXADECIMAL character that is a multiple of two and terminated
///   by a single-quote (u0027). Integer literals are a string of digits. The
///   plus or minus sign that might optionally preceed an integer is not part
///   of the integer token.
///
/// - H41220: SQLite shall recognize as an INTEGER token any squence of one or
///   more NUMERIC characters. An "exponentiation suffix" is defined to be an
///   upper or lower case "E" (u0045 or u0065) followed by one or more NUMERIC
///   characters. The "E" and the NUMERIC characters may optionally be separated
///   by a plus-sign (u002b) or a minus-sign (u002d). An exponentiation suffix
///   is part of the definition of a FLOAT token:
///
/// - H41230: SQLite shall recognize as a FLOAT token a sequence of one or
///   more NUMERIC characters together with zero or one period (u002e) and
///   followed by an exponentiation suffix.
///
/// - H41240: SQLite shall recognize as a FLOAT token a sequence of one or
///   more NUMERIC characters that includes exactly one period (u002e)
///   character.
///
///
/// #### Variables
///
/// Variables are used as placeholders in SQL statements for constant values
/// that are to be bound at start-time.
///
/// - H40310: SQLite shall recognize as a VARIABLE token the a question-mark
///   (u003f) followed by zero or more NUMERIC characters. A "parameter name"
///   is defined to be a sequence of one or more characters that consists of
///   ALPHANUMERIC characters and/or dollar-signs (u0025) intermixed with pairs
///   of colons (u003a) and optionally followed by any sequence of non-zero,
///   non-WHITESPACE characters enclosed in parentheses (u0028 and u0029).
///
/// - H40320: SQLite shall recognize as a VARIABLE token one of the characters
///   at-sign (u0040), dollar-sign (u0024), or colon (u003a) followed by a
///   parameter name.
///
/// - H40330: SQLite shall recognize as a VARIABLE token the shape-sign
///   (u0023) followed by a parameter name that does not begin with a NUMERIC
///   character.
///
/// The REGISTER token is a special token used internally. It does not appear
/// as part of the published user interface. Hence, the following is a
/// low-level requirement:
/// - L42040: SQLite shall recognize as a REGISTER token a sharp-sign (u0023)
///   followed by one or more NUMERIC characters.
